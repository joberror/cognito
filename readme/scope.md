The Scope of this project is to create a telegram bot that can be used to manage a media file sharing channel with lots of features ranging from media files, stats to user management.

- Each of this feature will have their separated branches as a way to tidy up developments, and will be merged to the main branch when necessary or achieved.

- Each feature will be carried out on orderly based, that is, every feature will go through a thorough testing and make sure it works to satisfaction before jumping to the next one.

- Features are to be listed in the `ai-readme > features.md` file, as a brief, and will be updated when new ideas are pitched in.

- Every feature will have their separate .md file in the `features` folder, detailing what these features are and how they will be implemented.

- Updates will be carried out regularly as testing and feedbacks rolls in.

- Note: this bot will be created with the hope that anybody can fork, configure and use it as long as they provide the necessary details required by the bot.

- This project will make use of Docker and Coolify for easier development and hosting.

- Simple logs will be used for logging, and will be stored in the `logs` folder, detailing what happened and when, for future review and understanding. The log folder will take a structural approach based on features, time, processing and prompts.

- Commands are what list out the features that are to be implemented explicitly, as every commands tied to their specific feature. These commands lies in the `readme > commands.md` file.
